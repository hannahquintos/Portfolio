                        <h5>October 4th, 2023</h5>
                    </div>
                    <div id="intro">
                        <p>It would be a lot easier to feel good about ourselves if we only saw sunny days, full of success and achievement. Unfortunately, that's not how life works. So, how can we see the rainbow after a storm? In other words, how can we learn to love and see the beauty in ourselves during times of failure?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id ="selfEsteem">
                        <h2>Self-Esteem</h2>
                        <p>Self-esteem is the positive evaluation of ourselves. It is often in comparison to others and is heavily influenced by social feedback. For instance, winning a competition or receiving praise can boost your self-esteem. On the contrary, losing or receiving criticism can lower your self-esteem. As you can see, self-esteem can easily fluctuate depending on the circumstance. As a result, it can be challenging to maintain a high self-esteem throughout all the ups and downs we experience. Self-compassion, however, can help us develop more stable feelings of self-worth and is especially important for coping with failure.</p>                    
                    </div>
                    <div id ="selfCompassion">
                        <h2>Self-Compassion</h2>
                        <p>Unlike self-esteem, self-compassion is a more inward perspective of yourself. It allows you to see yourself more clearly, identify and evaluate your weaknesses, and move past failure with an effective focus. Self-compassion's three main pillars are self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. A person high in these three elements will have high self-compassion.</p>
                        <div id="pillars">
                            <div class="pillar">
                                <h4>Self-Kindness</h4>

                                <p>Self-kindness is accepting your mistakes and failures and treating yourself with warmth and understanding. Essentially, treat yourself with the same kindness you would treat a friend.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="pillar">

                                <p>Common humanity is recognizing that you are not alone in your experience. Everybody experiences suffering, pain, and failure. It is viewing your experiences as part of the larger human experience.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="pillar">

                                <img class="pillarImage" src="./images/mindfulness-radish.svg" alt="Illustration of a radish character that's meditating.">
                                <p>Mindfulness is being aware of your thoughts and feelings. It involves acknowledging all your emotions and letting in both the good and the bad. It is not overly identifying with, avoiding, or repressing painful thoughts.</p>
